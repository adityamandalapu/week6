README

to compile the java files please use following command on command line:

javac Driver.java
javac GeneticAlgorithm.java
javac HillClimbing.java
javac Population.java
javac Solver.java
javac Sudoku.java

this will create class executables

to execute please use following commands:

java Driver <input text file>

    *without the "<" and ">"
    *text file name terminating with .txt suffix
    please make sure input files are in the same directory as class files
    
 The Driver class handles execution of both Hill Climbing and Genetic Algorithms
 
 Please refer to Driver.java to see test driven implementations for Sudoku class
 and running of Hill Climbing and Genetic Algorithm
